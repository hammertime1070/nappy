## Saves
- A save is a roll to avoid danger from a risky action or situation
- roll d20 if you roll equal to or under the appropriate ability score you pass
- 1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure

## Turns
- Generally a player would move and act, we will have players move or act
## Attacks
- attacker rolls a die dictated by their weapon subtracts opponents armor score
- attack does this much damage
## Damage
- when a unit takes damage they lose that much hp
- we would normally then do damage to their strength score then do a strength save, but
- instead once they lose their HP they will make a strength save, if they succeed they will gain one hp
- otherwise they die
